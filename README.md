Just-API is a robust, specification based, codeless API testing framework running on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Just-API allows users to test APIs without writing code.
Just-API takes API test specification from YAML files and runs them either in serial mode or in parallel mode as instructed by the user. It also reports errors and test results in several formats including HTML and JSON.
<br>

In simple terms, how it works is that you provide request and response validation specification in an yaml file. Just-API builds the request, makes a call to server
and validates response as per the specification.
You can choose to validate any or all of response status code, headers, JSON data, JSON schema or provide your own custom validator function.
